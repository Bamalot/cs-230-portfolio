# cs-230-portfolio
A portfolio submission for my last assignment in the CS-230 course.

The client for this submission, "The Gaming Room" was a game development team who wanted to design a team game. The game consisted off one team trying to guess what an image depicted as it was slowly revealed over 30 seconds. If they failed, the other team could guess. They wanted the game to be a cross-platform web application that would work on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS.

I thought that I designed the UML class diagram quite well, and it proved helpful later on. It made writing the code for the classes much easier, as I was just working from the diagram.

If I would revise one thing it would be the requirements section. After some feedback from my instructor the list of requirements was too vague and didn't give a good representation of both functional requirements and the required hardware and software.

I incorporated the user's needs every step of the way in the development process. Since I was trying to design a game based on the needs of the client, I made sure to meet every standard they set.

This course showed me a good method to designing software. I started with the needs of the client, and then worked from there. After the requirements were known, I diagrammed how the application would be laid out, and then worked on writing the code.
